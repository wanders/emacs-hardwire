* hardwire.el

This package allows reworking html documents replacing links to
external css and js file with the actual contents. With some luck this
will make the html file self contained. The primary use originally
intended is after org-mode exporting to html.

* Usage

Execute the function =hardwire-css-js-in-buffer= in a buffer. It try
to find all references to external stylesheets and scripts and
download those and /hardwire/ those into the html.
